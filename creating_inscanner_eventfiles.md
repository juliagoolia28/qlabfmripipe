# Creating fMRI Event Files
## Locating and Organizing Behavioral Event Data

Currently behavioral data is located in:\
smb://qilab.ling.udel.edu//data/projects/blast/data/mri/in-scanner-behavior\
\
Create an organized copy following current format in:\
Macintosh HD/Users/qigroup/Documents/project/blast/in-scanner\
-Copy the output_behavioral_template (main in-scanner folder) to the subject’s folder (change template to the subject ID)\
-Open the ASL folder\
      -Open the subject’s first auditory.csv file\
      -Column F identifies whether they began with random ‘R’ or structured ‘S’\
      -Column A identifies whether they began with tones (e.g. 1A) or syllables (e.g. pa)\
-In the subject’s new output_behavioral file you created, record this information into columns E and F\
      -In column G input which file this came from (A1=auditory run 1; V2=visual run 2)
